1. Run 'run.R' for model training and prediction.
2. Change line 12-18 to tweak file path.
3. If 'model.store.file' is present,train step will be skipped.
   Similarly,if 'train.feature.store.file' or 'prediciton.store.fil'e is present,
   respective feature extraction will be skipped.
4. Some loaded packages are only used in my experiment,not in final model.
